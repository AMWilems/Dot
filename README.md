## Installation



```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AMWilems/Dot.git
    cd Dot
    pip install discord.py python-dotenv
    python3 -m pip install -U yt-dlp
```
once depenancies are set up, you must next set up a bot through discord to create a connection to the application. using the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapplications). in the portal, create a new application, fill out the information for the application, and then copy the token that is created in the Bot tab.
The program will need the token to run in any capacity, which is stored in a .env file in the root directory of the bot. 

```bash
    cd Dot
    nano .env
```

in the .env, the Discord token should be placed within for secure connection to the Discord.py API with the following syntax:

```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your discord token>


in the .env, the Twitch API client_id and client_secret should be place for secure connection to the API with the following syntax:

```bash
client_id=<your client id>
client_secret=<your client secret>


You will also need an API key for the Jokes API. to generate the key, you need to create an account on [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/jokes-by-api-ninjas/). once an account is created, head to the same link, and copy the X-RapidAPI-Key key that is autogenerated. after which, add a line in to the .env using the following format:
```bash
X-RapidAPI-Key=<your key here>
```
your .env should look like this after these steps:
```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your discord token>
client_id=<your client id>
client_secret=<your client secret>
X-RapidAPI-Key=<your key here>
```

After doing so, save your changes, and exit the file. 

once all dependancies are in place, and .env file has been properly set up, the bot should run as intended on your local system!
